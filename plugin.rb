# description: To get started, load the [discourse-category-custom-fields](https://github.com/pavilionedu/discourse-category-custom-fields)
#              plugin in your local development environment. Once you've got it
#              working, follow the steps below and in the client "initializer"
#              to understand how it works. For more about the context behind
#              each step, follow the links in the 'references' section.

  # title:       Add getter and setter methods
  # description: Adding getter and setter methods is optional, but advisable.
  #              It means you can handle data validation or normalisation, and
  #              it lets you easily change where you're storing the data. 
  #              However, unlike topic custom fields, for category custom
  #              fields the setter method won't be used in the standard
  #              implementation as custom_fields are created and updated
  #              directly on the category model. See further in step 3.

  # title:       Update the field when the category is created or updated
  # description: In Discourse currently, category attributes are created and
  #              updated directly on the Category model. In both cases, any
  #              custom_fields passed to the relevant controller action will
  #              be created or updated directly as well. This means we don't
  #              need to add any handling for setting the field like we do
  #              with topic custom fields.

  # title:       Preload the field
  # description: Discourse preloads custom fields on listable models (i.e.
  #              categories or topics) before serializing them. This is to
  #              avoid running a potentially large number of SQL queries 
  #              ("N+1 Queries") at the point of serialization, which would
  #              cause performance to be affected.

  # description: In most cases where a category is used, it's taken from a
  #              list of categories sent to the client on the Site model. This
  #              is sent when the Discourse client is first loaded. The
  #              SiteCategorySerializer is also the parent of the more detailed
  #              CategorySerializer which is used to load more attributes in
  #              the category edit interface.
